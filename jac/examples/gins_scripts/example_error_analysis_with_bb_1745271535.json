The modulo operation `x % 2` will determine if `x` is even or odd. If `x` is odd, y is set to 0; otherwise, y is set to 4.  After the loop, `z` is calculated as `x/y`. When x is -49, this will cause y to be 0 if x is odd, resulting in division by zero. Add a check to ensure y is not zero before the division to avoid this error.",
