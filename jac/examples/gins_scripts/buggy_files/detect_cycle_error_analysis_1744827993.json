However, the initial setup sets both `hare` and `tortoise` to `node5`. The while loop condition is always true because `hare.successor` will always be evaluated until hare reaches None.The algorithm will then terminate because hare's successor is None, indicating no cycle.  This should be fixed by assigning the hare to point to node5.successor and the tortoise to node5.",
