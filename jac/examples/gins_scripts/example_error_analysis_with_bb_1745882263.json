The condition of the 'if' statement (x%2) is likely to evaluate to true and false multiple times leading to multiple assignments of y to 0 and 4.  The final value of y is unpredictable without execution. This makes the division in line 10 unsafe and the final output unpredictable.  Consider reviewing the loop's logic and the if statement's purpose.",
