The Euclidean algorithm for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) requires a different return value.  The function should return `a` when the loop terminates, not 0.\n\n\nHere's the corrected `gcd` function:\n\n```jac\ncan gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int {\n    while b {\n        (a, b) = (b, (a % b));\n    }\n    return a;  // Corrected return statement\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Error:**\n\nYour original `gcd` function always returned 0.  The `while b` loop correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm, but the final result (the GCD) is stored in the variable `a`.  Your `return 0;` statement overwrites this correct result with 0, leading to incorrect GCD values and failing assertions.\n\n**Corrected Code:**\n\nThe entire corrected Jac code should look like this:\n\n```jac\nimport:py from jaclang.runtimelib.gins.smart_assert, smart_assert ;\n\ncan gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int {\n    while b {\n        (a, b) = (b, (a % b));\n    }\n    return a;\n}\n\nwith entry {\n    testcases = [(48, 18, 6), (18, 48, 6), (7, 3, 1), (5, 0, 5)];\n    for (x, y, expected) in testcases {\n        got = gcd(x, y);\n        smart_assert(got == expected);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis corrected version will accurately compute the GCD and pass all the assertions in your `testcases`.  The `smart_assert` function will no longer fail.  Remember to re-run your Jac code after making this change."
