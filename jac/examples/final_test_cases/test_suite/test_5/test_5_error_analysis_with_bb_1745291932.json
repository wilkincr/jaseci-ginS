This is likely due to the initialization of `dp` matrix that is not correctly used in the subsequent loops. Review the logic of the dynamic programming solution and ensure the loops correctly update `dp` based on the intended algorithm.",

Since the execution frequency of lines 12-17 is 0, this indicates that the algorithm does not meet these conditions, and this section of the code is unreachable.  Analyze the algorithm implementation and initialization of `i` and `j` values. Double check the logic behind the `dp` calculation to ensure the values of `i` and `j` are correctly updated.",

It's critical to trace the algorithm using test inputs and verify the values of `i` and `j` after the loops. Correcting this requires improving the logic of the dynamic programming implementation.",
