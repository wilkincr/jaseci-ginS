If no subarray with a sum greater than or equal to the target is found, `min_length` remains `n + 1`. Thus, in the last `if` statement, it is compared to `n + 1` to determine if a solution was found.  This makes the code less readable.  Consider initializing `min_length` to a value that represents that no solution was found.   For example, initialize to -1 or some value greater than n, and change the conditional from `min_length == n + 1` to `min_length < 0` or similar",
