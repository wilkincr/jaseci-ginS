However, the initialization of `min_length` to `n + 1` might be inefficient in scenarios where the target sum is not found. Consider changing the initialization to a value that is more likely to be updated during the execution, perhaps a large number or directly to the length of the array to improve performance and prevent potentially unnecessary comparisons.",
