However, it is crucial to guarantee that the loop body alters `result` to equal the length of `names`.  The current implementation appears to achieve this, but a more explicit check might improve readability and maintainability.",

However, if `copy` is empty (which is impossible in this specific example because it's based on `names`), `random.randrange(0, len(copy))` will raise an IndexError. This should be handled by adding a check before accessing elements of copy.",
