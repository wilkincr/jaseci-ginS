Although it works correctly in most cases, there is a small chance the while loop condition `len(result) != len(names)` might not terminate if there are issues with the random number generator or if there is unexpected behavior with the list manipulation. Adding a counter to limit the number of iterations in the while loop would ensure termination even in edge cases. ",
