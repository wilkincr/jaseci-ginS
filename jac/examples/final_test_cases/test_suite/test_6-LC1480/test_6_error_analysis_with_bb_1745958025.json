This is correct for calculating the cumulative sums, but the logic could be slightly optimized for performance and clarity. The inner loop iterates through each element in nums, calculating the running sum and appending it to the running_sum list. For each element, the code adds the element to the total and appends the total to running_sum. This operation is correct, but it can be slightly optimized.  Instead of repeatedly calculating the sum, the code can directly add the previous element of running_sum to the current element. For example, in the first iteration, the code can append 0 to running_sum directly without any intermediate addition operation. In the second iteration, running_sum.append(running_sum[-1] + nums[1]) would be more efficient.",
