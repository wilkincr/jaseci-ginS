This is redundant and could be simplified by generating the `running_sum` during the comparison. There's also no need to separately store the `total` if it only used to calculate `running_sum` and is not used otherwise. This also eliminates the `+=` which is often a source of subtle errors and performance issues. This makes the code easier to read and maintain. ",

While it works correctly, it is not very efficient, as it needs to create a temporary array first. A more efficient approach would be to compare the element at each index during the sum calculation to eliminate the need for the extra array and the comparison at the end.",
