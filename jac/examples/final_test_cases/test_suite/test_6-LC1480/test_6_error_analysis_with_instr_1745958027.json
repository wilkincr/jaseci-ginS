However, it compares `running_sum` with `solution` only after the inner loop completes. This means that the comparison is done only once per outer loop iteration, and it doesn't provide feedback during the process. To make the comparison more fine-grained and potentially discover inconsistencies earlier, we can modify the code to compare `running_sum` with `solution` element by element inside the inner loop.",

The code assumes the lengths of `nums` and `solution` are always equal, which is true in the provided example data but may not hold for all inputs. It's essential to add checks for empty inputs or mismatched lengths to prevent potential runtime errors.",
