It should accumulate the sum of elements in `nums` and compare the accumulated sum with the `solution` at the end of the inner loop.  Currently, it appends `total` to `running_sum` and updates `total`. This causes `running_sum` to not accurately reflect the cumulative sum of `nums`.",

It should be done within the inner loop, not by appending the running total.",
