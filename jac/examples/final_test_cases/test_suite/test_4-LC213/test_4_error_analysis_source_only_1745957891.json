For arrays of length 0 or 1, the code handles the edge cases correctly by setting the answer to 0 or the first element, respectively.  For arrays of length 2, the code calculates the maximum of the two elements correctly, but doesn't cover all cases.  There is no bug, just an opportunity for code simplification and edge case consolidation.",
