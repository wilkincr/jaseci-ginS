The dynamic programming approach should correctly calculate the maximum sum of non-adjacent elements. The algorithm is correctly implemented and tested, however the test cases may not be comprehensive enough to cover all potential edge cases, such as very large numbers or specific patterns in the input lists.

Consider adding more robust assertions or logging for easier debugging. Also, printing the result of the comparison is not very informative. Add logging that prints intermediate results such as the calculated answer and the input list to aid in debugging and validation.",
