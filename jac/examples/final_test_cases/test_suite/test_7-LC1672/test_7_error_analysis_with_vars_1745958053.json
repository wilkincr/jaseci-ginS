After the inner loop completes, `max_wealth` will hold the maximum wealth among all customers. The condition `max_wealth == solution` checks if the maximum wealth equals the expected solution. The program will print `true` if they are equal, and `false` otherwise. For the given input, this will result in `false` for most cases, except for the first one where it is `true`. The logic is correct, but there seems to be a mismatch in the expected outcome based on how the program works.",
