However, at line 6 and later in the algorithm, the code treats them as lists. This inconsistency leads to logic errors because the program uses both list indexing (nums1_copy[index]) and the length of the lists in computations.  This can lead to index out of bounds errors.",

Without a proper condition to exit or an upper bound on the number of iterations, this will result in an infinite loop. The algorithm should ensure that the loop terminates under all conditions.",

Before accessing the list, the code checks to ensure that the index is within the bounds of the list.  However, this check should be improved to prevent potential exceptions.  Instead of relying solely on the `if` condition, add input validation before the list access to ensure `partitionX` and `partitionY` are within the list limits.",

In some scenarios, the conditions in the `if/elif/else` block might not adjust `low` and `high` appropriately, leading to an infinite loop. Introduce a counter to limit iterations, raise an exception after a certain number of iterations or ensure that `low` and `high` are always adjusted in every iteration.",
